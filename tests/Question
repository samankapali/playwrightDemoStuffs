Scenario: You are testing a web-based task management application. One of the core features is the ability to log in, create a new task, and verify that it appears in the task list.

Task:Using Playwright with Typescript, write a script that:
Launches a browser and navigates to a sample task management site (e.g., https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc).
Adds a new task with a unique name (e.g., "Test Task 001").
Verifies that the task appears in the list.
Optionally: 
Deletes the task and verifies it is removed.
Bonus (if time permits):• Parameterize the task name using a command-line argument or environment variable.• 
Add basic logging or screenshots on failure.
